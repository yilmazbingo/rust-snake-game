// Module is quite expensive operation/ also division expensive

Algorithmsâ€”The internal logic that is used to update the data structure while making sure that the invariants are not violated.

A priority queue is an abstract data structure that can be implemented in many ways (including as a sorted list). A heap is a concrete implementation of the priority queue using an array to hold elements and specific algorithms to enforce invariants.
